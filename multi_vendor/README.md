<!-- MARK: Removing the # from the url  -->
# Removing the # url
Getting the # in the url in the web as per removing have we have to change some of the code settings

In index.html add

In dart file in main.dart

# Riverpod

A method _checkAuthTokenAndNavigate() is used during app startup to check if a valid auth token and user information are stored. Based on this check, the app navigates to the home page or login page:

     Future<void> _checkAuthTokenAndNavigate() async {
          SharedPreferences pref = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
          String? token = pref.getString('auth_token');
          String? userJson = pref.getString('user');

          if (!mounted) return;

          if (token != null && userJson != null) {
               ref.read(userProvider.notifier).setUser(userJson);
               context.go('/homePage');
          } else {
               ref.read(userProvider.notifier).signOut();
               if (context.mounted) {
                    context.go('/loginPage');
               }
          }
     }

If both the token and user data are found, the user is considered authenticated and navigated to /homePage.

If not, they are signed out and redirected to /loginPage.

# Orientation 

Orientation of the code stick to the portrait-up as per to make the rotation of the application to work
edit:

In your main.dart, lock the orientation using SystemChrome remove this :
     
     // Lock app to portrait-up only
     await SystemChrome.setPreferredOrientations([
     DeviceOrientation.portraitUp,
     ]);

In AndroidManifest.xml, remove any orientation lock that might conflict with Flutterâ€™s orientation code:

     <!-- Remove this line if present -->
     <activity
     android:screenOrientation="portrait"
     ... >

n Info.plist, ensure the orientation entries allow Flutter to manage rotation. You can uncomment or adjust the supported orientations:

     <key>UISupportedInterfaceOrientations</key>
     <array>
          <string>UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait</string>
          <!-- Optional: remove landscape and upside-down orientations if you want strict portrait-up -->
          <!-- <string>UIInterfaceOrientationPortraitUpsideDown</string> -->
          <!-- <string>UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeLeft</string> -->
          <!-- <string>UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRight</string> -->
     </array>

<!-- MARK: Spread operator -->
# Spread Operator 
 Spread operator in the (...) that is used in this manner in the code 

     void main() {
          List<int> a = [1, 2, 3];
          List<int> b = [0, ...a, 4, 5];
          print(b); // [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
     }

this can be only used in List,set or map 
As to add the element of the one list to the other z
